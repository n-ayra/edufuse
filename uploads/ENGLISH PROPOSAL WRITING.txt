CHAPTER I


Introduction
1.1  Introduction


Over the last five years, the Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) has gone through ups and downs, which are influenced by both domestic economic conditions and global market dynamics. It kept oscillating between strengthening and weakening against major currencies such as the United States (US) dollar, which further affects the Malaysian economy in certain aspects.


However, there is proportionately few coverage of studies on the changes in currency fluctuations affecting Malaysia’s economy specifically compared to developed countries. These factors should be further investigated since it has implications on the Malaysian economy, affecting various sectors and destabilizing economic standing.


        This study aims to identify the factors causing the MYR currency to fluctuate, how it affects Malaysian economic growth and to analyze ways to stabilize the MYR currency especially during uncertain global financial conditions.


        This chapter will provide an introduction to the study by first discussing the background and context, followed by the research problem, research aims, objectives, and questions, the significance and finally, the limitations.


1.2 Background of Study


Currency plays a critical role as an economic communication tool, encapsulating the value of a country’s economic transactions (Auer et al., 2022). The Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) has faced significant volatility in recent years, influenced by a combination of domestic and global factors. Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have created persistent instability (Chia et al., 2023). The Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) fluctuation causes prolonged economic growth (Adam Aziz, 2023). MYR fluctuations not only affect Malaysia’s trade balance but also influence various aspects of everyday life, from rising import costs to business risks and investors. 


The study made by Irwan Shah Zainal Abidin in his book, Reflections on the Malaysian Economy Post-GE 14: Issues and Challenges predicted that the claimed misconduct practise through the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) saga was one of the causes that contributed to Malaysia’s economic struggles. After the General Election, GE14 the government made it a solution to re-evaluate the position of Goods and Service Tax (GST) in Malaysia's economy as a tax evaders solution to renew Malaysia’s economic shape. It is debated that GST could be the cause of high cost of living. However, the GST removal did not alleviate the high cost of living, highlighting structural economic issues beyond taxation policies.


Macroeconomic studies have shown that Malaysia maintains a relatively low and steady inflation rate, with significant peaks only during major economic crises. For example, inflation spiked to 17.3% in 1974 but remained below 1% during 2009’s global financial downturn (Musarat et al., 2021). Despite this, fluctuations in the MYR have exacerbated financial pressures on businesses and households by increasing the cost of imports and reducing export competitiveness (Adam Aziz, 2023).


        To address this issue, many previous studies suggest implementation of monetary policies, such as interest rate adjustments, and re-evaluating taxation frameworks. Structural reformation was also suggested to mitigate currency volatility and safeguard economic resilient ability. The existing studies provide foundation for further investigation into factors influencing MYR to fluctuate, strategies to stabilize the MYR, and ensure sustainable economic growth amidst global financial uncertainties.


1.3 Research Problem


The Malaysian ringgit has seen extreme fluctuations over the past years, which are mostly driven by internal factors such as political turmoil, shifts in global markets, and changes in commodity prices (Stash Away, 2024). Numerous research regarding currency fluctuation and its economic effects are mostly focusing on developed countries or general trends as covered in a study done by Stojanov et al.(2024).


        However, the impacts of currency fluctuations in developed nations have been extensively studied, but less attention has been given to how these changes affect Malaysia in particular. Most studies either focus primarily on factors without examining their cascading implications on Malaysia's domestic economy, or they simply generalise findings across emerging economies. For instance, Butt et al. (2023) examine the factors such as interest rate differentials, yet their study overlooks how these fluctuations affect crucial economic factors and governance challenges specific to Malaysia.


        As a result, the existing research provides an insufficient structure for comprehending the specific challenges that result from Malaysian currency fluctuations. The absence of specific study will limit the stakeholders' capacity to predict and effectively address economic disruptions brought on by exchange rate volatility. Therefore, addressing this research gap is crucial to improving Malaysia’s financial stability and ensuring that the nation can effectively navigate the complexities of currency fluctuations in an increasingly volatile global economy.


1.4 Research Objectives


The research objectives are as follows:-
1. To identify what causes the Malaysian Ringgit to fluctuate.
2. To assess how these fluctuations impact Malaysia’s economic growth.
3. To analyze ways to stabilize the Ringgit, especially during uncertain global financial conditions.


1.5 Research Questions


The research questions are as follows:-


1. What are the primary factors contributing to the fluctuations of the Malaysian Ringgit in recent years?
2. How do fluctuations in the Malaysian Ringgit affect Malaysia’s economic growth, particularly in terms of trade, inflation, and investment?
3. What strategies can be implemented to stabilize the Malaysian Ringgit during periods of global financial uncertainty? 
________________
1.6 Significance


This study will contribute to the Malaysian government policymakers stabilising the economy by understanding currency changes. This is because policymakers can effectively create and implement monetary and fiscal policies suitable for Malaysia’s economic environment. Past studies (Chia et al., 2023) indicated that structural adjustments or reforms in the taxation system and adjustments in the interest rate in reaction to the movement of the market can temper the movement of the currency and protect the economy. The importance of this knowledge is critical for ensuring we have a stable macroeconomic environment, especially with increasing global uncertainties such as political instability, global market fluctuation, and commodity price adjustment. Therefore, the findings of this study will contribute to aiding policymakers in preserving Malaysia's financial stability.


        Moreover, this study will help business firms in managing risks arising from Ringgit fluctuations. Business operations are directly impacted by currency fluctuations, such as those involved in international trade. An increase in exchange rate can make imports more expensive, reduce the competitiveness of exports, and increase financial uncertainty. However, firms can implement appropriate risk management tactics, such as hedging to reduce the potential losses by understanding the specific factors influencing the Ringgit. 


        Lastly, this study will educate Malaysian citizens about how these fluctuations affect daily life. Changes in the Ringgit impact the economic well-being of the citizens by influencing the cost of living, inflation rates, and savings. For instance, increasing import expenses brought on by currency depreciation may result in higher prices for necessities, placing a burden on household finances (Adam Aziz, 2023). Therefore, this study gives citizens the ability to make wise decisions by educating them on the causes and effects of currency fluctuations.
1.7 Limitations of Study


The limitations are as follows:-
   1. Limited sample scope: The study only focuses on Malaysians who are employed and corporate shareholders as its subject sample. This, therefore, omits other relevant groups such as small business owners. The reliance on employed citizens excludes insights from marginalized group who may be disproportionately affected by currency fluctuations such as low income households
   2. Limited Access to Diverse Respondents: The study may face resource constraints, such as time and funding, could limit the ability of this study to recruit a wider number of respondents. That limitation could substantially impede its capacity to recruit more diverse, larger numbers of samples, especially from the different regions within Malaysia.
   3. Methodology: The use of questionnaires and interviews brings about the problem of response bias, where participants may give socially desirable responses rather than accurate or truthful information, thus threatening the validity of the study.
   4. Generalization of findings: The findings from the questionnaires and interviews may not be representative of the entire Malaysian population therefore limits the conclusions from the study.

CHAPTER II
Literature Review
This section explores existing knowledge on the existing knowledge on the fluctuations of the Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) and their implications for the Malaysian economy by analysing existing literature and studies both from both local and international perspective. According to Learn Basic English and Research Writing (2023), related literature provides theoretical insights from books or journals without systematic research or findings, while related studies involve prior systematic research with design, respondents, and findings. The objectives are to identify the causes of MYR currency fluctuations, assess their impact on Malaysia’s economic growth and analyze potential strategies for stabilizing the MYR currency. By examining various findings and methodologies from the studies and literature done by these researchers, this chapter will provide synthesis to inform the research that will be done.


2.1 Fluctuations of the currency
Currency fluctuations refer to changes in the value of a country's currency relative to other currencies, influenced by factors such as economic conditions and inflation. These changes can have significant effects on a country's economy, such as altering trade balances, impacting inflation and introducing risks for businesses and investors​
2.2 Factors Contributing to the Fluctuations of the Malaysian Ringgit Currency


Studies on currency fluctuations worldwide provide crucial insights into MYR dynamics, particularly within the Malaysian context. Chia et al. (2023) analyzed regulatory mechanisms in East-Asian markets, demonstrating how interest rates, inflation, and global financial conditions interact in determining currency values. Their findings reveal that monetary policies, such as interest rate adjustments, are insufficient without comprehensive fiscal interventions, emphasizing the need for a multi-faceted approach to stabilize currencies. This provides a foundational understanding of global market influences, which are particularly relevant to MYR's performance.


Building on this, Majuca (2020) examined the impact of fluctuating oil prices on Malaysia’s economic indicators, including the stock market and exchange rate. The study highlights the vulnerability of commodity-exporting countries like Malaysia, where oil price volatility directly influences the MYR. This underscores the importance of diversification strategies to reduce reliance on commodities, complementing the broader fiscal measures suggested by Chia et al. (2023).


Lim et al. (2020) further explored the role of political stability in currency values, revealing that political uncertainty exacerbates currency volatility by undermining investor confidence and economic performance. They argued that enhancing political stability could mitigate currency fluctuations, creating a more favorable environment for implementing fiscal and diversification strategies. Together, these studies illustrate how global financial conditions, domestic economic policies, and political factors collectively shape MYR dynamics, reinforcing the need for integrated policy measures.


2.3 Effects of Currency Fluctuations on Malaysia’s Economy
Foreign literature provides valuable insights into the global implications of currency fluctuations, which are critical for understanding their effects on Malaysia’s economy. Shah et al. (2021) examined regulatory mechanisms in East-Asian markets, concluding that weak enforcement systems lead to unstable currency values. This underscores the need for strong regulatory frameworks as a foundation for stabilizing currencies, aligning with Malaysia's ongoing efforts to enhance governance and monetary stability.
Musarat et al. (2021) highlighted how inflation affects cost overruns in construction projects by driving up material and labor prices. This finding illustrates the broader economic impact of inflation, particularly in Malaysia, where currency fluctuations amplify cost pressures across multiple sectors. The study emphasizes that controlling inflation is essential for maintaining economic stability and mitigating the ripple effects of a volatile MYR.
Building on this, Hashim et al. (2019) analyzed key economic indicators such as unemployment, inflation, and interest rates, demonstrating their interdependent effects on Malaysia’s economic growth. For instance, rising inflation weakens the value of the MYR, increasing the cost of goods and services, which can, in turn, exacerbate unemployment and slow growth. These dynamics highlight the complex feedback loop between currency stability and broader economic health.
Yusof et al. (2021) further explored the role of fiscal management, identifying poor governance and unsustainable government spending as major contributors to currency devaluation. Their findings reinforce the need for prudent fiscal policies to address the economic consequences of MYR fluctuations. When combined with robust regulatory reforms (Shah et al., 2021) and inflation control measures (Musarat et al., 2021), these strategies offer a comprehensive framework for stabilizing Malaysia’s economy.

2.4  Research Technique in Studies
In analyzing various research methodologies, it's evident that studies like Chia et al. (2023) and Yusof et al. (2021) employ quantitative approaches to examine economic relationships. Chia et al. utilized econometric modeling, specifically the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and Granger causality tests, to explore both short-term and long-term interactions between variables such as interest rates, inflation, and the Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) exchange rate. Their data collection relied on secondary sources, including economic reports from East Asian nations and global financial databases like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), covering quarterly data from Q1 2009 to Q3 2022.


Similarly, Yusof et al. (2021) applied the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression method to analyze the relationship between the inflation rate (dependent variable) and factors like government expenditure, exchange rate, unemployment rate, and economic growth (independent variables). They utilized 30 years of annual data (1991–2020) sourced from databases such as the World Bank and Thomson Reuters DataStream.


In contrast, qualitative methodologies, such as thematic analysis, offer a different lens for exploring economic phenomena. For instance, Wasik (2013) conducted a study on factors influencing currency exchange rate fluctuations in Kenya, employing thematic analysis to interpret qualitative data gathered through interviews and questionnaires. This approach enabled the identification of patterns and themes related to economic strength and expectations, providing a nuanced understanding of the factors affecting currency fluctuations. 


Thematic analysis is particularly useful for interpreting complex qualitative data, allowing researchers to identify and analyze patterns or themes within the data. It involves a systematic process of coding and theme development, facilitating a deeper understanding of participants' perspectives and experiences (Saul, 2024). 


By examining these diverse methodologies, researchers can gain insights into the strengths and limitations of different analytical approaches, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of economic issues such as currency fluctuations.


2.5 Gaps in Current Research


Local studies provide valuable insights into the MYR currency but reveal significant gaps, particularly in research focused on Malaysia’s unique economic and political context. For example, Abidin (2021) examined the economic repercussions of political scandals, such as the 1MDB case, on fiscal policies and investor confidence. While the study highlighted the potential for governance reforms to reduce economic instability, it did not explore how these reforms specifically impact the stability of the MYR. This lack of Malaysia-specific research leaves a critical gap in understanding the direct relationship between governance improvements and currency stabilization.


Similarly, Abidin’s (2021) analysis of Malaysia’s post-GE economic landscape identified challenges and opportunities for governance reforms, such as enhancing transparency, addressing corruption, and strengthening institutions. However, there remains a dearth of studies examining how these reforms could influence MYR fluctuations in the long term. This highlights the need for research focused specifically on the Malaysian context to bridge the gap between governance reform and currency stability.


Another gap lies in the role of financial education in Malaysia’s economic resilience. While Bakar and Bakar (2020) emphasized the importance of financial literacy among younger demographics to mitigate inefficiencies and instability, there is little research on how financial education could directly strengthen Malaysia’s resilience to MYR fluctuations. Addressing this gap would provide critical insights into the potential of financial literacy to contribute to long-term currency stability in the Malaysian context.


Furthermore, Abdul Manaf (2019) explored the negative impact of the Ringgit’s depreciation against the US dollar on bank profitability, underscoring the importance of currency stability. However, this study focused primarily on the financial sector and overlooked broader economic indicators such as GDP growth, employment rates, and trade balances. There is a need for Malaysia-specific research to investigate the wider economic implications of MYR fluctuations and develop comprehensive strategies for mitigating these effects across various sectors.


Overall, the gaps in the existing literature reflect insufficient study on Malaysia-specific factors influencing MYR fluctuations and their broader implications. Future research must address these gaps to provide targeted insights and actionable strategies tailored to Malaysia’s economic and political landscape.

Methodology


3.1 Introduction


This section outlines the participants of the study, detailing who will be involved and their role in contributing to the research. Following this, the research instruments will be discussed, focusing on the tools and methods employed to collect and summarize the data. Data gathering procedure section will discuss the process of data gathering.  Finally, the chapter is summarised in the conclusion.


3.2 Participants of Study
The participants of this study were carefully selected to align with the research objectives. Employed Malaysian citizens were chosen to provide insights into the factors contributing to fluctuations in the Malaysia Ringgit, as they are directly impacted by the changes in the currency's value in their daily lives and purchasing power. Next, shareholders of corporate businesses were also included as their roles in financial decision-making and investment offer a unique perspective on how these fluctuations affect economic growth and the corporate sector. Thus, these two groups of participants in the study are crucial to gather a comprehensive understanding of currency fluctuations.
        Other than that, Opinions from specialists in the field, such as business analysts and economic analysts will also be gathered regarding currency fluctuations. Business analysts are selected for their expertise in assessing how currency volatility affects corporate operations, financial strategies, and trade relations. On the other hand, economic analysts are chosen for their specialized knowledge in evaluating macroeconomic trends, including currency movements, inflation, and government policies.
3.3 Research Instrument
This research plan aimed at understanding the effects of Malaysian Ringgit fluctuations on the economy. It highlights three main objectives, identifying the causes of the fluctuations, assessing their impact on economic growth, and exploring strategies for stabilization. Each objective is linked to specific data analysis methods, instruments, and target samples.
The research instruments are through questionnaires and interviews. The questions in these methods include demographic, economic, financial literacy, personal financial planning, and a set of qualitative questions to provide comprehensive understanding of participants’ financial behaviours and needs. Demographic questions gather background information such as shown in Table 1, enabling grouping and providing context for other variables. The questions provide multiple choice questions and respondents can only choose one answer (Yeop, 2010).

        Advanced financial literacy questions assess respondents’ understanding on key investment concepts in Malaysia's stock market. Questions as shown in Table 3 evaluate awareness of the risk differences between bonds and stocks, the higher long-term returns of stocks, the volatility of stock prices due to market situations, and the need to spread investments (Boon, 2011). Presented as multiple-choice questions with options for correct, incorrect, or "do not know" responses, this approach identifies knowledge gaps and supports tailored financial education.

        Personal financial planning questions aim on evaluating individuals’ approaches to managing investments using a Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree). These questions assess understanding of key concepts such as recognizing one’s risk profile to align investments with tolerance levels, ranging across various instruments to mitigate risks, and appreciating the power of compounding interest to grow wealth over time (Boon, 2011). Additionally, they explore reliance on opinions from friends and family when making investment decisions, highlighting the need for independent judgment. The Likert scale captures the intensity of participants’ opinions, offering insights into their financial planning behaviors and attitudes.

        The qualitative questions aim to gather respondents' opinions on the factors influencing the Malaysian Ringgit, its impact on economic growth, and strategies for stabilization as shown in Table 5. In Section 1, questions explore external factors like global markets and political stability affecting the Ringgit, as well as recent events influencing its value. Section 2 investigates how currency fluctuations impact business operations, corporate profits, and specific sectors more significantly affected by the Ringgit's volatility. Section 3 seeks insights into effective government strategies, the role of fiscal and monetary policies, and contributions from businesses and individuals to stabilize the currency. Responses are open-ended, allowing for detailed and subjective insights, capturing individual perspectives and experiences. Answer Type: Open-ended text responses.

3.4 Data Gathering Procedure


The data gathering procedure uses equal proportions of questionnaires, interviews, and secondary data. Surveys will be developed to capture how identified factors affect employed Malaysia citizens and corporate shareholders as all responses collected will be anonymous, and the results will be aggregated. To gain detailed information on how these factors play out, interviewed corporate shareholders will explain their experiences across the specific criteria. Any opinions from specialist individuals in the area such as business analysts and economic analysts, will also be obtained on currency fluctuations. Business analysts will be selected for their expertise in understanding how currency volatility impacts corporate operations, financial strategies and trade relations. Meanwhile, economic analysts are chosen for their particular background in analyzing macroeconomic trends, such as currency movements, inflation, and government policies. This is supported by insights from Krugman et al. (2017), who emphasize the role of experts in interpreting international economic trends, and Aslam (2020), who discusses the impact of currency movements on economic growth. Furthermore, more secondary data from reliable sources including the central banks and government initiative reports will support the primary data. This guarantees the inclusion of both qualitative and quantitative research data inputs.


3.5 Data Analysis
The data gathered from questions proposed in Section 3.2, will be analyzed using the project’s objectives. For the first objective, descriptive analysis through questionnaires will be used to gather insights from employed Malaysian citizens about the factors influencing currency fluctuations. The second objective involves thematic analysis of interviews with corporate shareholders to explore how these fluctuations affect businesses and economic growth. The final objective combines descriptive and thematic analyses, utilizing both questionnaires and interviews to collect data from employed citizens and corporate shareholders about potential strategies to stabilize the Ringgit during global financial uncertainties. This two approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the issue by targeting diverse perspectives and employing mixed methods to analyze the data effectively. 
3.6 Conclusion
This study aims to understand the impacts of currency fluctuations on Malaysia’s economy by using both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Based on previous studies, the research adopts methods that address the specific research questions. Primary data is collected through questionnaires and interviews with employed Malaysian citizens, corporate shareholders, and financial experts, providing insights into the effects of currency instability. This is supported by secondary data from sources like the World Bank, IMF, and Malaysia’s national economic statistics. By combining these data sources, the study analyzes MYR fluctuations from both macroeconomic and microeconomic perspectives. The use of mixed methods ensures reliable findings could possibly support the development of strategies to manage currency volatility and improve economic stability in Malaysia.
